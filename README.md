# Privily

## Description
Anti Snooping browser extension for Google meet, Zoom Meetings Web App and Slack which blurs everything important to save your privacy in public and unblurs them on hovering.

## What led to this? ü§î
Somewhere in March 2020, COVID-19 struck the world rendering it motionless and with heavy losses. Led to rise of work from home culture.

Folks are working from home more, correct?
*But are folks working from home with an extended safety of privacy?* Not really. 

Imagine a scenario where...
1. **A meeting outside**
- You are working in a cafe or in a metro with your masks and earphones on.
- You are attending a very important meeting with sensitive information on display.
- You are listening to all of it keenly but...
- The people next to you keep staring at your screen and yes, we know, it gets uncomfortable. :)

2. **A call with friends at home**
- You are being yourself with your friends 
- Your friends does something extremely hilarious which well, you probably won't show your folks

Now, you can't really change people can you? 
**But you can definitely change your meeting**
